<img width="1174" height="659" alt="Dashboard_preview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60bc27d4-3468-4c7b-acc6-ae46af7adbd0" />

### Business Objective
This project solves a core challenge in global Fintech: **normalizing fragmented transaction data across multiple currencies and identifying customer churn risk. Financial institutions process large volumes of transactions daily. Understanding these transactions is key for: detecting unusual or potentially risky behavior, identifying high-value customers, improving operational and business decisions** I built an end-to-end data pipeline that cleans duplicate logs, handles FX rate gaps (weekends/holidays) using a Forward Fill strategy, and classifies 100% of the customer portfolio (including inactive leads) using a custom **Risk Scoring Engine**.

### Tech Stack
* **SQL (SQLite):** Data cleaning, Window Functions, and Forward Fill logic for FX rates.
* **Python (Pandas):** Statistical segmentation and Feature Engineering.
* **Power BI:** Interactive Dashboard for Business Intelligence and KPI tracking.

### Data Pipeline
#### 1. SQL Layer (Data Integrity and Normalization)
* **De-duplication:** Used `ROW_NUMBER()` to enforce uniqueness on Transaction IDs.
* **FX Forward Fill:** Implemented a "Last Known Value" logic using `COUNT() OVER` and `FIRST_VALUE` to handle missing exchange rates on weekends/holidays.
* **Base Currency Conversion:** Standardized all transactions (JPY, GBP, USD) to **EUR** to ensure a "single version of the truth" for financial reporting.

#### 2. Python Engine (Strategic Segmentation)
* **Recency Logic:** Calculated the gap between the last transaction and the reporting date to flag users with >30 days of inactivity as **"At Risk"**.
* **Monetary Scoring:** Used the **80th percentile (Pareto Principle)** to identify "Top Tier" clients, excluding inactive leads to avoid statistical skew.
* **Full Portfolio Coverage:** Handled missing values (Imputation) to ensure that even customers with 0 transactions are tracked as **"Inactive Leads"**.

### Business Insights
* **Revenue:** **Germany** is the country that has the highest total amount of transactions accounting **23%** of total revenue, focus in Germany as a target market.
* **Churn Alert:** Identified a **17.02% Churn Rate**, providing the marketing team with a specific list of **16** "At Risk" customers for re-engagement.
* **Portfolio Mix:** 19% of the database consists of high-value "Top Tier" customers, while 6% are leads that haven't converted yet.

### How to Run
1.  Run `Database_logic.sql` to initialize the cleaned views.
2.  Execute `Risk_analysis_engine.py` to generate the segments.
3.  Open `Fintech_dashboard.pbix` to view the interactive insights.

### Limitations
* The dataset is static and does not reflect real-time transaction processing
* No advanced machine learning models were applied
* Results are exploratory and would need further validation in a real-world setting.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates a structured approach to analyzing financial transactions and extracting insights that can support business decisions. It highlights the importance of moving beyond descriptive analysis toward more actionable insights.

**Note: To comply with data protection standards, all datasets used in this project were synthetically generated. The data simulates real-world fintech transaction patterns, including currency fluctuations and customer behavioral trends.**
